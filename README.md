- Hash usernames (`SHA256`)
- Strip links from messages
- Store everything in a `.db` file under `data/<channel>/`

### `/data`

Folder structure:

```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ KaiCenat
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 20250524005632.db
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ PokiMane
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

### `.db` files

Each `.db` file is labeled by start stream timestamp and contains a table named `messages` with columns for `id`, `timestamp`, `channel`, `user_hash`, and `content`.
